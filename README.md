# Machine learning notes

> ðŸš§ This is a work in progress!

Notes written while taking the [Stanford machine learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning). I decided to use Jupyter notebook and do all computation in Python rather than Octave, so some of the code will be quite different.

Unfortunately, with Jupyter notebooks on GitHub internal links are broken (along with some rendering errors), so it may be better to view the notes in [Jupyter Notebook Viewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/liamross/machine-learning-notes/tree/master/).

All illustrations done using [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

## Modules

1. [Introduction](1_introduction.ipynb) - basic terminology for machine learning
1. [Linear regression with one variable](2_linear_regression_with_one_variable.ipynb) - most of these are build on more completely in 4
1. [Linear algebra review](3_linear_algebra_review.ipynb) - an optional refresher on matrices and vectors
1. [Linear regression with multiple variables](4_linear_regression_with_multiple_variables.ipynb) - builds on 2 with multi variable algorithms
