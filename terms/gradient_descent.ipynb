    "# Gradient descent\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is a way of estimating the best parameters for a function. Depending on the function, gradient descent may converge on local optima (a local \"low point\") rather than the global optima. The steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. choose an arbitrary starting value for each parameter\n",
    "2. \"step downhill\" (towards lowest proximal function value)\n",
    "3. continue until you reach a global minimum value for your function\n",
    "\n",
    "> There is a [normal equations method](normal_equations_method.ipynb) which will solve the same problems without multiple steps, but it doesn't scale as well with large training sets\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be an arbitrary number of $\\theta$'s, but the following graph shows just two: $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$.\n",
